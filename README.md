# Project Title

DrumMachine Built with React and Bootstrap react.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a modern build setup for React applications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several commands:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This command launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. It's a good way to ensure that your code is working as expected. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. This way, your app is ready to be deployed!
